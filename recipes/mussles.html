    <h2>Delicious Cooked Mussels</h2>
    <p>This is a simple 10 minute recipe for delicious cooked mussels, you can eat them by themselves, or in a seafood pasta if you prefer, yum!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 Pounds of Mussels</li>
        <li>1 Shallot</li>
        <li>3-4 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup White Wine</li>
        <li>1 Cup Veggie Broth</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Olive Oil or Butter (or both)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure this is being cooked in a pan with a lid</li>
        <li>We want to first check the mussels, if there are any that are open tap them on a counter or hard surface. If they do not close within a short time 3-5 seconds, throw them out.
            additionally if any are cracked throw them out as well. This should be fairly obvious, when in doubt throw it out.
        </li>
        <li>Next once you have checked the mussles give them a good rinse</li>
        <li>Next we'll want to chop the garlic and shallot and place them into a pan with butter and let cook on medium high heat, after a few minutes toss in the mussels</li>
        <li>Immediately pour in the veggie broth and white wine and cover for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes check to see that all the mussels have opened, if not continue for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy! :)</li>
    </ol>
